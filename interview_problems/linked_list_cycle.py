# https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/
# Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
# There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list
# that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
# Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to.
# Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
# Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
